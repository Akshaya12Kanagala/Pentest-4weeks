DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web security vulnerability.
It occurs when a web application updates the Document Object Model (DOM) without properly checking it.

In a DOM-based XSS attack, the attacker injects malicious code into the web page, and the web application without checking it and executes this code within the user's browser.

I used the payload ">icode<script>alert(1)</script>

Here "> is used to close the image tag and the normal payload <script>alert(1)</script> to get a alert box saying 1

payload refers to the actual malicious code or data that an attacker injects into a web application to exploit a vulnerability.
