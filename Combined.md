After downloading the combined challenge, we get the combined.zip file 
we unzilp the file ( unzip combined.zip) since a ZIP file is used to compress one or more files together into a single location. This reduces file size and makes it easier to
transport or store, to restore the compressed files we unzip or extract the zip files.
After unzipping we get 3 files chall.png(combined image of pepe&incredible), pepe.png and incredible.png.
After unzipping the file I used binwalk to check for embedded files( to check for any inserted  object within the document)
And I used few of the tools given in bi0s wiki, later I used the stegonocraphy tool stegsolve to solve the image
Download the stegsolve using wget http://www.caesum.com/handbook/Stegsolve.jar -O stegsolve.jar
after downlading it, give it permission 
chmod +x stegsolve.jar
and now create any file (here i used bin as given in the bi0s wiki)
 mkdir bin
 mv stegsolve.jar bin/
 And now change the directory to bin and open stegsolve using 
 java -jar stegsolve.jar

after that, the stegsolve opens and after getting the hint from the challenge name Combined, I tried Combines the pepe.png & incredible.png image and saved it, later I combined 
the chall.png & combined picture of pepe.png and incredible.png 

And I got the Flag
