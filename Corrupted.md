After Downloading the Corruppted file and unzipping it.

I checked the file format using file flag.png when i got the result as data(which means it is not in the png format) so to change it I tried changing the magic numbers of the file
using Hexedit flag.png 

Magic numbers: first few bytes of a file that are unique to a particular file type.

Magic number of png image file is  89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A

After changes the magic numbers the file is now in png format 
And I used binwalk for any embedded files.

We get _flag.png.extracted 

I tried to open the image in stegsolve where I got the flag 
vidyutctf{4r3_y4_w1nn1ng_s0n?}
